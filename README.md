## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/IquKaNq.png)

ChatGPT is all over social media. I built my first JavaScript AI, a ChatGPT AI App using Open AI's newest machine learning model. With an elegant User Interface that resembles the ChatGPT app, communication with advanced GPT 3 model API and the ability to ask the AI for help coding in JavaScript, React JS or any other programming language, giving it code and translating it to another language.
